    /* Encapsulation vs Data Abstraction

Encapsulation is data hiding(information hiding) while Abstraction is detail hiding(implementation hiding).
While encapsulation groups together data and methods that act upon the data,
data abstraction deals with exposing the interface to the user and hiding the details of implementation.


Advantages of Abstraction

It reduces the complexity of viewing the things.
Avoids code duplication and increases reusability.
Helps to increase security of an application or program as only important details are provided to the user.*/
