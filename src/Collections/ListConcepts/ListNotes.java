    /*Collection(I): extended by List, Set, Queue
		size is automatically adjusted

		List(I): implemented by ArrayList(C), LinkedList(C), Vector(C)==> Stack(C)

				has index number, accepts duplicates


				ArrayList(C): array based class, internally uses the array

								retrieving data is faster ( get() )

				LinkedList(C): each objects are doublly linked

						doubly linked ===>add/remove are faster


				Vector(C): is synchronized, it's thread safe in multi-thread envireonment


				Stack(C): child of Vector, it's thread safe in multi-thread envireonment

					pop(): LIFO, last in first out
							return the last object in the stack, and removes it from the stack
